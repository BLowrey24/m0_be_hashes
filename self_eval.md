# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I think I mainly struggled with trying to google things I found it much easier to just work alongside with someone and tackle it with to brains instead
of one.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going very well I've found that I've taken more notes now then I think I have throughout my whole life and wish I would've 
always taken notes.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I leaned towards doing it on my own and trying different things and then I would usually reach out to a partner to get their perspective.
